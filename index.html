    <h2>Welcome to the Battle Born PVP Quick Start Guide</h2>
    <p>This is a 5 minute guide for running with the Battle Born PVP guilds in WoW. Steps 1, 2, and 3 will get you functional ASAP if you are in a Battle Born premade right now. Please read Step 4 at your earliest convenience. This guide is intended to help players new to premade groups quickly ramp up to contribute maximally to the raid and thus reap the benefits of a raid that is crushing the opposing team. If you go through this process and have improvements to suggest, please hit up Amithu or a Battle Born officer. For information on how Ashran works, see <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/guides/world-events/pvp/comprehensive-ashran-guide" target="_blank">Wowhead's guide.</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Disable Damage Meters</h2>
    <p>Disable any damage meters like Skada or Recount. They will lag the raid.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Set up Discord</h2>
    <p>Discord is a voice communication program. We use it to allow the raid leader to change objectives and strategy instantly and for the raid to respond instantly to those changes. Talking is optional, listening is mandatory. If you already have Discord installed, clicking the link will take you to the appropriate Discord. If you do not have it installed clicking the link will take you to a place to download the installer. Note that after joining the right Discord you will still need to enter a voice channel to hear. The relevant channel is usually Ashran Premade 1 or 2.</p>
    <p>Horde Premade Discord: <a href='https://discord.gg/78KFeSB' target="_blank">https://discord.gg/78KFeSB</a></p>
    <p>Alliance Premade Discord: <a href='https://discord.gg/jSuFvCF' target="_blank">https://discord.gg/jSuFvCF</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Make a Focus Assist Macro</h2>
    <p>This macro will let you set the raid leader as your focus and when you use it to target, it will target the raid leader's target. This enables the raid to quickly burn down high value targets to disrupt the opposing team.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Combined Macro</h3>
    <pre>#showtooltip
/focus [mod:ctrl]
/clearfocus [mod:alt]
/assist focus [nomod]</pre>
    <p>Holding down the Control key while clicking the macro will set your focus to the player you have selected. Holding down the alt key will clear your focus. Clicking on the macro will attack your focus' target.</p>
    <p>If you have problems with this macro due to hardware or keybinding issues, you can make separate macros:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Set Focus Macro</h3>
    <pre>/focus</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Assist Focus Macro</h3>
    <pre>/assist focus</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Rules of Engagement</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Treat all players with respect, especially the opposing team. Give them the opportunity to show up as honorable warriors. If they don't, take the high road. Don't respond to trolls but do let an officer know what's going on.</li>
      <li>No cheating. This includes intentionally lagging the opposing team, joining the opposing team as a spy, monitoring their Discord, or doing anything to undermine the opposing teams ability to meet us as equals on the field of battle.</li>
      <li>Be helpful. The way to grow the skills of the raid is to teach people what they don't know. Conversely, if you don't know something, ask!</li>
      <li>Follow the raid leader. Second guessing them in raid chat weakens the raid. If you have suggestions on strategy, discuss them after the battle or better yet, take advantage of our leader training and lead groups the way you want to!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Ashran</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Your road toys such as <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=118425/nesingwarys-lost-horn" target="_blank">stampedes</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=116984/frost-wyrm-egg" target="_blank">frost wyrms</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=118426/scroll-of-invoke-yulon-the-jade-serpent" target="_blank">serpents</a> are under the raid leader's control, not yours. Please use them only at the direction of the raid leader.</li>
      <li>Unless specifically directed by the raid leader, never touch the graveyard or the road circling it. Doing so will start a timer that will eventually give the graveyard to your team. Get in the habit of avoiding the road around the graveyard by always using the grass. The graveyard is an excellent place to farm the opposing team for the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/quest=39090/slay-them-all" target="_blank">Slay Them All</a> quest.</li>
      <li>Never use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=116410/scroll-of-speed" target="_blank">speed scrolls</a> in a fight. If there is a risk of you accidentally using one, delete the speed scroll from your inventory or remove the button from your bars. Using speed scrolls in a fight will cancel <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=116411/scroll-of-protection" target="_blank">protection scrolls</a> and can wipe the raid. DO use them when entering or leaving the Ashran Excavation event as a group.</li>
      <li>Occasionally at ROC glowing fires will rise from the braziers. These fires give the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=169691/burning-power" target="_blank">Burning Power</a> buff which increases the rate of mana/energy/focus/rage/runes regeneration. Save these fires for the healers since they are keeping your asses alive. Healers, get these buffs whenever you can, but note that it takes a few minutes after the end of the buff before you can click on the flame again, so if you only have a couple of minutes on your old buff and you dispel it, you won't be able to get a new one right away. Similarly, at Brutes Rise there are sometimes cages with an ogre inside. Clicking the cage frees the ogre and grants the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=169372/boulder-shield" target="_blank">Boulder Shield</a> protective buff. Save these for the healers too!</li>
      <li>When necessary, raid members will drop a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=112324/nightmarish-hitching-post" target="_blank">Nightmarish Hitching Post</a>. Clicking on it will grant the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=162997/nightmarish-reins" target="_blank">Nightmarish Reins</a> buff which transforms your mount into a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=112326/warforged-nightmare" target="_blank">Warforged Nightmare</a> for 20 minutes. While this buff is active, replace the mount on your mount button with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=116397/swift-riding-crop" target="_blank">Swift Riding Crop</a>. Make sure this buff is active too. For the duration of the first buff, whenever you use your mount button you will not only mount instantly, you can mount in combat too. Note that when the buff wears off, clicking your mount button will use up a crop instead. Since everyone's buff will wear off around the same time, someone should be dropping a post when you need it.</li>
      <li>Manage your buffs well. Maintain your own stores of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=114982" target="_blank">song flowers</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=111842" target="_blank">tubers</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/legion-alchemy-guide#flasks" target="_blank">flasks</a>, etc. and check periodically to make sure the buffs are still active. Expect the opposing team to dispel your buffs when they can. Battle Born will provide feasts.</li>
      <li><b>BUG:</b> In the Ashran Excavation event do not be on the opposing side when the event is won. If you draw aggro from any npc you will be unable to mount and any healer that heals you will spread the bug to anyone else they heal. The only solution at that point is for the entire raid to die. To prevent this, if you are hit by this bug and are unable to mount outside combat, you need to die asap so it doesn't spread to the whole raid in the next fight. #5 counteracts this bug.</li>
      <li><b>BUG:</b> In the Ashmaul Burial Grounds event, do not be in the water when the event ends or you won't get credit.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Optional Add-Ons and Tips</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><a href='https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/h-h-t-d' target="_blank">H.H.T.D.</a></h3>
    <p>Healer management is critical in PVP. This Add-On will show you who is a healer and their current level of effectiveness (rank). If you are DPS and are inclined to hunt healers, this Add-On will help you target them. Consider marking or neutralizing the top ranked opposing healers on sight. It will also alert you when your friendly healers are under attack. If you are DPS its a good idea to have an idea of where your healers are and if you have availability during a fight, defend your healers when you are notified that they are under attack. Currently this Add-On is more effective at healer targeting than protection so we need to up our healer protection game manually. Assume that the opposing team has this installed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><a href='https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ashranbuddy' target="_blank">Ashran Buddy</a></h3>
    <p>If you would like to learn to lead in Ashran this Add-On will help you keep track of events.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>If you are a healer, at the very least you should be using mouse over macros. Here is a sample that also includes your current focus target. It can be useful to keep your focus on the raid leader, Ancient Artifact carrier, or anyone you specifically want to keep tabs on:</p>
    <pre>#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover,help,nodead][@focus,help,nodead][@player] Rejuvenation</pre>
    <p>This macro will first try to cast on the unit you have moused over. If that doesn't exist it will cast on your focus. If you don't have a focus set, it will cast on you.</p>
    <p><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2" target="_blank">WeakAuras</a> is a useful add on for keeping track of procs and cooldowns while keeping your eyes on the action. It has a decently steep learning curve so ask for help if you need it.</p>
    <p>Spend time optimizing your macros and UI. For example, rather than a Druid having separate buttons for different forms and having to spend brainpower tracking if they are indoors or not, use a travel form macro that just picks the fastest available form and spend your brainpower on healing or hunting.</p>
    <p>Learn how to use your crowd control and defensive spells effectively. The more crowd control on the opposing side the better.</p>
